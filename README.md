## Portfolio-Mija-Dilberovic

Website was built with a responsive layout with several sections;

- Header and nav bar links;
- About me section with a short introductory paragraph;
- Work section with 3 projects and 1 upcoming project;
- Footer containing contact info.

# Nav bar links

When clicking on the nav bar links UI opens separate page to the appropriate section.

# Work

4 projects cards with background images and link to live site and GitHub repo. Styling was done with Bootstrap to make the responsive layout. Jquery was added to switch between sections. After each section in the navbar is clicked the page slowly goes away and appropriate section is displayed.

# Footer

Footer contains all the contact info, phone email and LinkedIn account. These are all links to make it easier to be contacted, eg clicking on email it automatically populates a template.
